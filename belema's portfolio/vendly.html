            <h1>Vendly Design</h1>
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>Vendly is a decentralized platform that enables small and 
                medium-sized businesses to sell <br> products and access financing
                 without restrictions. It is a social commerce platform that

            <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges faced by online vendors
                 is effectively reaching <br> and engaging their target audience,
                  retaining customers, and managing their<br> presence on various
                   social media platforms. This can be a complex and time-<br>consuming
                    task that requires careful planning and execution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="context-text">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>As the only designer on the team, which also included 
                one UX writer and four engineers, I was in charge <br> of 
                conducting user research and creating the visual design
                 for the platform. Although <br> the hackathon was brief, we
                  were able to accomplish several key achievements, 
                  including:<br> </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>

                <br> <b>We used design sprints as a way to guide and 
                    inform our process:</b> Through the use of
                     design<br> sprints, I was able to successfully
                      identify the problem at hand, generate ideas
                       for solutions,<br> create prototypes, and ultimately
                        produce the final product. </li>
                <li>
                <br><b>Implemented a design process for the project:</b>
                 By implementing a design process, our team <br> was able to
                  establish more structure in how we approach our work
                   and allow other teams to <br>have visibility into our 
                   upcoming sprints. This has been beneficial in helping
                    us to be more <br>organized and efficient. </li>
                <li>
                <br><b>Creating a design system:</b> Having a design
                     system in place helps to ensure that the overall <br>
                      visual identity and user experience remains consistent
                       throughout the platform.</li>
                <li>
                <br> <b>End to end execution:</b> The speed at which
                 the engineers were able to turn the designs into<br> code 
                 showed our efficiency and ability to work together as a
                  team to deliver new features.
            </li>
            <h3>The process</h3>
            <p>Our design process for vendly is based on the
                <b> ‘Design thinking process’.</b> We aim to<br> incorporate 
                 the key phases of Product definition, Research,
                  Analysis, design, and validation in <br>our project.</p>

        <div class="body-content">
            <h3>UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>The Design Thinking process is a structured 
                approach to problem-solving that involves empathy,
                <br> ideation, prototyping, and testing. By conducting
                  interviews with five online vendors, I was able to
                  <br> gather valuable insights into their pain points.
                    Through this process, I was able to understand 
                   <br> their needs and problems in greater detail, which
                     helped to design solutions that are tailored to their 
                     specific needs.</p>
                     <h3>GOALS OF THE RESEARCH</h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li>To identify the difficulties and issues faced by online vendors</li>
                        <li>To determine the types of businesses owned by online vendors and
                             those that are more successful in an online setting.</li>
                        <li>To understand the online platforms currently being used
                                by online vendors for their businesses.
                         </li>
                         <li>To learn about the techniques and approaches used by
                                 online vendors to manage their businesses and financial
                                  account online.  </li>
                        <li>To determine if only vendor use sponsored advertisement 
                            to increase visibility and drive traffic to their businesses.</li>
                            
                     </ul>
                     <p>We conducted an online survey and received responses from 96 
                        vendors and 52 buyers who <br> have been actively engaged in online
                         buying and selling for the past six months, based on <br>which we
                          analyzed the results.

                <p>By collecting data from user interviews and surveys, my team

         <h3>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h3>
         <img src="./images/vendly IA@1 1.png" width="700px">
         <h3>DESIGN</h3>
         <p>Throughout the project, we conducted user testing at every stage to identify and 
            address any <br>problems or issues with the current version. After gathering feedback,
            we would update the <br> prototypes and test again. In terms of branding, we aimed to
            design a minimalist, clean user <br> interface that conveyed a sense of trustworthiness
            and forward-thinking for our target audience.</p>
         <h3>Landing PAGE</h3>
         <p>I desired a landing page with a straightforward call-to-action that clearly 
            communicates our goal <br> and includes all other relevant information provided by the platform</p>

         <h2>RESULT AND TAKEAWAYS</h2>
         <p>Working at an early-stage startup was a very steep learning curve. It was an enlightening
           experience that taught me a lot about the importance of being efficient and strategic
           in terms of where to focus my energy and efforts.</p>
         <h4>‍Some key takeaways from this project are:</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Prioritize building a minimal viable product (MVP). As a startup, it is essential to be
                 mindful of limited time and resources, so it is important to focus on the features
                  that will provide the most value to users. </li>
             <li> Do not get too caught up in the details. Earlier on, I made the
                 mistake of focusing too much on the appearance of the user interface. However, 
                 reevaluating the user flows helped me to refocus on the user experience.</li>
             <li>Keep the problem you are trying to solve for your users in mind. Ultimately,
                 your goal is to address the pains and challenges of your users, so it is important
                  to stay focused on that, even when you are busy with daily tasks.</li>
