                <h1>AIRSYN DESIGN</h1>
                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>The AirSyn Monitor is a sensor device that uses 7 sensors to detect and
                     measure various gas pollutants, such as Carbon monoxide and excess cooking gas,
                    in your environment.

                   <br><br> The AirSyn Monitor comes with a software that detects the presence of
                    various gaseous pollutants and the level of pollution in the environment. It 
                    also alerts individuals of any potential hazards in the surrounding area.
              </p>

         <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
          <p>Users of the air monitoring software reported difficulty in understanding the data
             provided by the software and the hardware device. They also reported difficulty 
             in interpreting the data and taking action based on the information provided. 
             Additionally, users had difficulty in setting up the hardware device properly 
             and connecting it to the software</p>
       </div>
  </div>
  <div class="line-text">
     <h3>Background</h3>
     <p>Air pollution is a major public health concern, with poor air quality linked 
       to a range of health issues such as respiratory problems, heart disease, and 
       cancer. To address this issue, our team developed an air monitoring software
        that tracks and reports on the quality of the air in a specific location.
        The software is used in conjunction with a hardware device that detects 
        and measures various pollutants in the air.</p>
        <h3>UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM</h3>
        <p>To understand the problem, we conducted user research by
             interviewing users and observing them using the software
              and hardware device. We found out the following;</p>
        <uL>
            <li>Users had a difficult time understanding the data provided 
                by the device, as the information was presented in a confusing and technical manner.</li>
            <li>Additionally, users had trouble interpreting the data and taking action based
                 on the information provided.</li>
        </uL>
  </div>
  <div class="project">
    <h2>Project vision and solutions</h2>
    <p>To address these issues from our research, we decided to redesigned the software interface to;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make it more user-friendly and easier to understand.</li>
        <li>Used clear and simple language to present the data.</li>
        <li>Added visual aids to help users interpret the information.</li>
        <li>Create a step-by-step guide for setting up the hardware device and connecting it to the hardware,
            to make the process easier for users.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To begin, we conducted market research on competitors to explore 
        what was currently available<br> in the market and to gather inspiration 
        for features we liked in existing platforms. I then led a <br>15-minute 
        sketching session to allow team members to visually communicate their ideas
         for the<br> solution.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mvp">
    <h3>Defining the MVP</h3>
    <p>From the sketching sessions, it became clear that there were 
        shared themes in our product vision. The following key user stories were identified:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Find devices:</b> Users can locate the various AirSyn devices that are registered to them.</li>
        <li><b>Check for pollutants:</b> Users can view the pollutants present
             and the level of pollution in the environment on their dashboard.</li>
        <li><b>generate reports:</b>Users can generate reports for various pollutants and track
             their level over a specific period of time</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="./images/Frame 902.png" width="600px">
    <h3>Designs</h3>
    <p>Based on our sketches, I began designing the main screens, 
        and then moved on to the styling. We decided to use a dark theme for the design.</p>
    <h3>registration</h3>
    <p>For the registration screens, I created a straightforward sign-up and login form.</p>
    <img src="./images/Frame 903.png" width="600px">
    <h3>onboarding </h3>
    <p>The process of onboarding users to set up their devices was made more user-friendly
         by breaking it down into smaller, manageable modules to avoid overwhelming the user.</p>
    <img src="./images/Frame 903 (1).png" width="600px">
    <h3>dashboard</h3>
    <p>The dashboard displays information about all devices, including which ones are active,
         safe, and unsafe, as well as the overall status of the environment and any notifications.</p>
    <img src="./images/Frame 903 (2).png" width="600px">
    <h3>Devices</h3>
    <p>The devices display information about the pollutants measured by a specific device, 
        including its location and status, as well as any related notifications.</p>
    <img src="./images/Frame 905 (5).png" width="600px">
    <h3>Report</h3>
    <p>The report feature enables users to generate reports on one
         or multiple pollutants at various time intervals and export them as PDFs.</p>
    <img src="./images/Frame 903 (3).png" width="600px">
    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>The profile section holds information about the users and their subscription details.</p>
    <img src="./images/Frame 903 (4).png" width="600px">

       <div class="evaluation">
        <h2>EVALUATION</h2>
        <p>We evaluated the effectiveness of the redesign by conducting 
            user testing with a group of users. We found that users were able to;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the data provided by the device more easily.</li>
            <li> Had an easier time interpreting the information and taking action based on it.</li>
            <li>users find the step by step guide for setting up the hardware device useful. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>Our redesign of the air monitoring software and the addition of a step-by-step guide for setting up the hardware device improved the user experience for users. By making the data provided by the device more understandable and actionable,
             we were able to help users take steps to improve the air quality in their location.</p>
